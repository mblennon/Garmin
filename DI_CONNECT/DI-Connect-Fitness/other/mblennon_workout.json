with each set in order to get the same or more rest – the choice here is yours after you’ve seen what is coming up in Part 2! Part 2 starts with some 100s at CSS pace with a short 15s rest. You’ll need to use the top re-sync button on your Tempo Trainer Pro to re-start the beeper cycle at the start of every 100 after your rest. Now add 2s per 100 for your 200 goal pace, knocking this one off as comfortably as possible with an eye on the following 800 to complete the session. For the 800 add a further 4s per 100 to what is currently displayed on the Tempo Trainer Pro, taking your target to a seemingly “pedestrian” target of CSS +6s/100.

To pass the time and improve your pedal economy, Excelsior includes Form Sprints, Endurance Spinning intervals, Pistons/Kick & Pull pedaling drills as well as some Single-Leg Focus to keep you engaged over this long haul.\n\n\nForm Sprints: Practice high-rpm sprint simulations at low power outputs to reinforce proper sprinting technique by jumping out-of-the-saddle and winding up a light gear. As your cadence reaches its controllable peak, gracefully transition into the saddle where you can shift gears if necessary. These sprints are only 10s long and are all about leg speed, form, & technique. Experiment with which foot to lead with, and learn how to generate a lot of leg speed in very little time.\n\n\nEndurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural, self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minute...","updatedDate":"2021-06-02T01:05:43.0","createdDate":"2019-12-11T01:00:11.0","sportType":{"sportTypeId":2,"sportTypeKey":"cycling","displayOrder":2},"author":{"userPro":false,"vivokidUser":false},"estimatedDurationInSecs":15300,"workoutSteps":[{"type":"ExecutableStepDTO","stepId":2402982858,"stepOrder":1,"stepType":{"stepTypeId":7,"stepTypeKey":"other","displayOrder":7},"description":"ACTIVE","endCondition":{"conditionTypeId":2,"conditionTypeKey":"time","displayOrder":2,"displayable":true},"endConditionValue":15300.0,"targetType":{"workoutTargetTypeId":1,"workoutTargetTypeKey":"no.target","displayOrder":1},"strokeType":{},"equipmentType":{}}],"avgTrainingSpeed":0.0,"estimatedDistanceUnit":{},"shared":false,"atp":false},{"workoutId":175872762,"ownerId":4128102,"workoutName":"Fang Mountain","description":"Fang Mountain is 4x9-minute over-under intervals with 1-minute valleys at 95% FTP and 2-minute peaks that ascend to 105% FTP.\n\n\nRecoveries between OU's are 6-minutes long.","updatedDate":"2021-06-02T00:27:17.0","createdDate":"2019-12-11T00:30:58.0","sportType":{"sportTypeId":2,"sportTypeKey":"cycling","displayOrder":2},"author":{"userPro":false,"vivokidUser":false},"estimatedDurationInSecs":4500,"workoutSteps":[{"type":"ExecutableStepDTO","stepId":2402925848,"stepOrder":1,"stepType":{"stepTypeId":7,"stepTypeKey":"other","displayOrder":7},"description":"ACTIVE","endCondition":{"conditionTypeId":2,"conditionTypeKey":"time","displayOrder":2,"displayable":true},"endConditionValue":4500.0,"targetType":{"workoutTargetTypeId":1,"workoutTargetTypeKey":"no.target","displayOrder":1},"strokeType":{},"equipmentType":{}}],"avgTrainingSpeed":0.0,"estimatedDistanceUnit":{},"shared":false,"atp":false},{"workoutId":175872230,"ownerId":4128102,"workoutName":"Fang Mountain","description":"Fang Mountain is 4x9-minute over-under intervals with 1-minute valleys at 95% FTP and 2-minute peaks that ascend to 105% FTP.\n\n\nRecoveries between OU's are 6-minutes long.","updatedDate":"2021-06-02T00:19:32.0","createdDate":"2019-12-11T00:25:41.0","sportType":{"sportTypeId":2,"sportTypeKey":"cycling","displayOrder":2},"author":{"userPro":false,"vivokidUser":false},"estimatedDurationInSecs":4500,"workoutSteps":[{"type":"ExecutableStepDTO","stepId":2402915014,"stepOrder":1,"stepType":{"stepTypeId":7,"stepTypeKey":"other","displayOrder":7},"description":"ACTIVE","endCondition":{"conditionTypeId":2,"conditionTypeKey":"time","displayOrder":2,"displayable":true},"endConditionValue":4500.0,"targetType":{"workoutTargetTypeId":1,"workoutTargetTypeKey":"no.target","displayOrder":1},"strokeType":{},"equipmentType":{}}],"avgTrainingSpeed":0.0,"estimatedDistanceUnit":{},"shared":false,"atp":false},{"workoutId":175872290,"ownerId":4128102,"workoutName":"Fang Mountain","description":"Fang Mountain is 4x9-minute over-under intervals with 1-minute valleys at 95% FTP and 2-minute peaks that ascend to 105% FTP.\n\n\nRecoveries between OU's are 6-minutes long.","updatedDate":"2021-06-02T00:21:12.0","createdDate":"2019-12-11T00:26:52.0","sportType":{"sportTypeId":2,"sportTypeKey":"cycling","displayOrder":2},"author":{"userPro":false,"vivokidUser":false},"estimatedDurationInSecs":4500,"workoutSteps":[{"type":"ExecutableStepDTO","stepId":2402917639,"stepOrder":1,"stepType":{"stepTypeId":7,"stepTypeKey":"other","displayOrder":7},"description":"ACTIVE","endCondition":{"conditionTypeId":2,"conditionTypeKey":"time","displayOrder":2,"displayable":true},"endConditionValue":4500.0,"targetType":{"workoutTargetTypeId":1,"workoutTargetTypeKey":"no.target","displayOrder":1},"strokeType":{},"equipmentType":{}}],"avgTrainingSpeed":0.0,"estimatedDistanceUnit":{},"shared":false,"atp":false},{"workoutId":175869392,"ownerId":4128102,"workoutName":"Fast Finish","description":"5min Zone 1\t\t\n20min Zone 2\t\t\n10min Zone 3\n\nA fast finish run tacks a relatively short effort in Zone 3 onto the end of a foundation run.

Blackburn","description":"This workout consists of 4 long hours of Aerobic Endurance, most of which is spent between 60-70% FTP with a few stretches as high as 85% FTP.\n\n\nTo pass the time and improve your pedal economy, the workout includes optional Form Sprints, Endurance Spinning intervals, Pistons/Kick & Pull pedaling drills as well as some Single-Leg Focus to keep you engaged over this long haul.\n\n\nForm Sprints: Practice high-rpm sprint simulations at low power outputs to reinforce proper sprinting technique by jumping out-of-the-saddle and winding up a light gear. As your cadence reaches its controllable peak, gracefully transition into the saddle where you can shift gears if necessary. These sprints are only 10s long and are all about leg speed, form, & technique. Experiment with which foot to lead with, and learn how to generate a lot of leg speed in very little time.\n\n\nEndurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural, self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your comfortable...","updatedDate":"2021-06-02T01:08:50.0","createdDate":"2019-12-11T01:02:22.0","sportType":{"sportTypeId":2,"sportTypeKey":"cycling","displayOrder":2},"author":{"userPro":false,"vivokidUser":false},"estimatedDurationInSecs":14400,"workoutSteps":[{"type":"ExecutableStepDTO","stepId":2402986792,"stepOrder":1,"stepType":{"stepTypeId":7,"stepTypeKey":"other","displayOrder":7},"description":"ACTIVE","endCondition":{"conditionTypeId":2,"conditionTypeKey":"time","displayOrder":2,"displayable":true},"endConditionValue":14400.0,"targetType":{"workoutTargetTypeId":1,"workoutTargetTypeKey":"no.target","displayOrder":1},"strokeType":{},"equipmentType":{}}],"avgTrainingSpeed":0.0,"estimatedDistanceUnit":{},"shared":false,"atp":false},{"workoutId":175875324,"ownerId":4128102,"workoutName":"Mount Bond","description":"3 hours of Tempo intervals spent between 70-80% FTP with intermittent, 3-minute recoveries at 55% FTP.\n\n\nThese are meant to simulate climbs, so elevating your front wheel is a good idea if your key event(s) include climbs.

Like foundation runs, speed play runs are done mostly in Zone 2. But this low-intensity backdrop is punctuated by short bursts at high intensity, as in interval runs. Speed play runs are generally intended to be somewhat easier than interval runs, though, and are traditionally done on trails or roads instead of at the track. They are used most often as a low-key way to include some high-intensity running in the base phase of training, when increasing the overall volume of running is the top priority.
